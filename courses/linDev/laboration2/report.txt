Create three directories, data, admin and market
Create three users adam, peter, lisa
Create three groups datagroup, admingroup and marketgroup
Set up a system where adam and peter gets read/write access to data, adam and lisa gets read/write access to admin and peter and lisa gets read/write access to market. Everybody else should have no rights to these directories.

Useful commands are adduser, deluser, chmod, chown, chgrp, gpasswd

Hand in a written report on how you solved this task, and the appropriate copies from /etc/group, /etc/passwd and outputs from ls -l <your directory where you created the above directories>

1. Laboration 2

This laboration presents basic command-line interface user management of a Linux/Unix based system.

Creation of three different directories with the names "data", "admin" and "market".
code: mkdir data admin market

Creation of three different user accounts with no password and no ability to log in before a password has been linket to those accounts (for security reasons). The names of the new user accounts on the system is "adam", "lisa" and "peter". The system also creates home directories in the /home/ folder by default.
code:
adduser --disabled-login adam
adduser --disabled-login lisa
adduser --disabled-login peter

Creation of three different user groups with the names "datagroup", "admingroup" and "marketgroup".
addgroup datagroup
addgroup admingroup
addgroup marketgroup

For this laboration we want the three directories "data", "admin" and "market" to be exclusively handled by the groups "datagroup", "admingroup" and "marketgroup", respectively. By this we mean that no one else but the members (users) of the respective group will have read, write, or execution permissions to the directory in question, as well as its contents. 

To achieve this we first remove all permissions "others" have regarding these three directories.
code: 
chmod o-rwx data
chmod o-rwx admin
chmod o-rwx market

The different user groups were then given group ownership over their respective directory.
code:
chgrp datagroup data
chgrp admingroup admin
chgrp marketgroup market

The above commands only changed the group ownership, but for the members of the different groups to actually be able to write to the respective directory the groups had to be given write permission, like so.
code:
chmod g+w data
chmod g+w admin
chmod g+w market

Three different users were at this time present on the system, as well as three different user groups, and three different directories with the right permission setup. The different users were then granted the right directory permissions by adding them to the right user group.
code:
	adduser adam datagroup
	adduser peter datagroup
	adduser adam admingroup
	adduser lisa admingroup
	adduser lisa marketgroup
